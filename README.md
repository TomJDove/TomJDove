# Tom Dove

I'm a PhD student at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 
My research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality. 
My thesis is about the equivariant versions of these concepts.
In plainer language, I study the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models in string theory together which the mathematical structures we use to classify their properties.

Previously, I completed by Masters degree at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Nora Ganter.
