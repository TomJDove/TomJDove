I'm a PhD student at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 
In plain language, I study the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models in string theory together which the mathematical structures used to classify their properties.
In less plain language, my research interests are in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality. 
My thesis is about the equivariant versions of these concepts.

Previously, I completed by Masters degree at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Nora Ganter.
