# About

<p align="justify">
I'm an experienced researcher with a mathematics and informatics background. I'm passionate about using my analytic, data and programming skills to solve real-world problems that make a positive impact.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I recently completed a PhD at the University of Göttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 
In plain language, I studied the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models and the mathematical structures that classify their properties.
More precisely, my research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality.
My thesis was about the equivariant versions of these concepts.

# Portfolio

- [Quantium Virtual Internship](/TomJDove/portfolio/quantium) \\
Completed a job simulation focused on data analytics and commercial insights. Used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy) to analyse transaction and customer data to give insights on customer segmentation and purchasing behaviour and identified benchmark stores for conducting uplift testing on trial stores.

- [AFL Power BI Report](/TomJDove/portfolio/afl-power-bi) \\
I transformed raw AFL data into an interactive Power BI report that allows users to draw insights on season-wide trends, team performance metrics, and individual player statistics. This demonstrates my proficiency in data visualisation and analytics while providing a valuable resource for stakeholders in the AFL community.

- [Excel dashboard on drug use in Victoria](/TomJDove/portfolio/drugs-victoria) \\
I created two Excel dashboards on drug use in Victoria using data on ambulance attendances and hospital admissions. They provide a comprehensive overview of drug-related incidents in Victoria and allow the user to monitor trends, analyse demographic factors and compare the impact of different types of drug use.

- [Gender representation analysis in mathematical research](/TomJDove/portfolio/arxiv-gender) \\
Using Python/Pandas to process metadata from ArXiv, the preeminent repository of mathematical research articles, I conduct an in-depth analysis of gender representation based on author names. I reported the findings in Power BI, creating a report that allows users to extract their own findings from the repository.

- [Tableau dashboard on political donations in Australia](/TomJDove/portfolio/political-donations) \\
Using data published by the Australian Electoral Committee, I use Tableau to create a dashboard that sheds light on the nature of political donations in Australia. With it, the user gets a holistic overview of political contributions to help inform policy decisions and government transparency initiatives.

- [Predicting AFL matches with machine learning](/TomJDove/portfolio/afl-prediction) \\
  I implemented a machine learning model using Python (Pandas, Sklearn) to predict the outcome of AFL matches based on historical data. Tested a variety of models and ensemble methods, with logistic regression and linear SVMs giving the best results.

- [AFL SQL demonstration](/TomJDove/portfolio/afl-sql) \\
I demonstrate my SQL competence by querying an AFL database. Through increasingly complex queries I extract player statistics and team performance metrics that allow the successful prediction of a grand final match.

- [University projects](/TomJDove/portfolio/university-projects) \\
I completed a variety of complex projects at university; an RPG game in Java, a multithreaded TCP server implementing a proof-of-work algorithm, a simple web application with a database backend, and a controller for a car to traverse a maze.
