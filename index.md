# About 

<p align="justify">
I just completed a PhD at the University of Göttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 
In plain language, I studied the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models and the mathematical structures that classify their properties.
More precisely, my research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality.
My thesis work is about the equivariant versions of these concepts.

<p align="justify">
I'm now back in Melbourne and looking for opportunities to apply my hard-earned skills to solve real-world problems.
