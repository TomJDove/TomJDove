# About

<p align="justify">
I'm a software developer with a PhD in mathematics.
I'm passionate about using my analytic, data, and programming skills to solve real-world problems that make a positive impact.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I completed a PhD at the University of Göttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 
In plain language, I studied the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models and the mathematical structures that classify their properties.
More precisely, my research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality.
My thesis was about the equivariant versions of these concepts.
