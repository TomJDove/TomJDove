I created a Power BI report that allows one to investigate a wide range of AFL statistics, from goals scored to bounces, at a season, match and player level.
The .pbix file can be found on my <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/17inMSe-Quv3xXVwVQaLnOg7JL_do4Suy/view?usp=sharing'>Google Drive</a>.
Screenshots of the report can be found below.
</p>

Features of the report include: 
    - Navigation buttons on the left hand side.
    - Disconnected tables used to make side by side team comparisons.
    - Interactive buttons using bookmarks.
