I have completed the <a href='https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb'>Quantium Virtual Internship</a>, which is a job simulation focusing on data analytics and commercial insights.
The code is available in Jupyter notebooks, as well as exported PDFs, in the following <a href='https://github.com/TomJDove/quantium-virtual-internship'>GitHub repository</a>.
I completed the project using Python, in particular Pandas for the data analysis and Seaborn for the visualisations.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
The setup for the internship was the following: the retail analytics team and have been approached by a supermarket client that wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase chips and their chip purchasing behaviour within the region.
The insights from our analyses will feed into the supermarket's strategic plan for selling chips in the next half year.

### Task 1 - Data preparation and customer analytics

- Developed expertise in data preparation and customer analytics, using transaction datasets to extract valuable insights and deliver data-driven commercial recommendations.

<p align='justify'>
In this task, we cleaned and analysed transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. 
We identified the customer segments that contributed most to sales and examined their purchasing behaviour.
I used Seaborn to create visualisations to communicate our findings and produce clear recommendations for the client's strategy.

### Task 2 - Experimentation and uplift testing

- Extended analytical capabilities to identify benchmark stores for conducting uplift testing on trial store layouts, enabling evidence-based decision-making.

<p align='justify'>
New trial layouts are being tested in three of the client's stores, and we have been tasked with analysing the effect of these trials and determining whether they have increased sales.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
First, we chose control stores to compare with the trial stores during the trial period. 
We developed metrics to quantity how similar a store is to the control store in the pre-trial period so that we could choose a control store for each trial store that is most similar.  
</p>

<p align='justify'>
We conducted T-tests in each of the trial months to determine if there was a statistically significant increase in sales and the number of customers during the trial period, visualising the results with a graph.

### Task 3 - Analytics and commercial application

- Leveraged acquired data analytics and insights from previous tasks to create comprehensive reports for the Category Manager, facilitating informed strategic decisions and enhancing commercial applications.

<p align='justify'>
In this part of the internship we had to summarise our findings in a PowerPoint presentation that incorporated data visualisations, key insights, and recommendations.
This honed my ability to recognise commercial, actionable insights from my analysis and present them clearly and concisely to a client.
