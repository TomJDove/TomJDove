I created two dashboards in Excel to explore the data on ambulance drug attendances and hospital admissions compiled by [AODstats.org.au](AODstats).
I've uploaded the Excel workbook to my Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPFZAZQMgdFiQsO5bCOzTSJrrcVuKVxu/view?usp=sharing).
The first dashboard looks at the Victoria-wide statistics and the second looks at the statistics for individual drugs.
