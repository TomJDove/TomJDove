## About 

I just completed a PhD at the University of Göttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 

In plain language, I studied the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models and the mathematical structures that classify their properties.

More precisely, my research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality.
My thesis work is about the equivariant versions of these concepts.

I return to Melbourne in late November and will be seeking opportunities outside of academia.
