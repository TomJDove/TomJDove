## About 

I'm a PhD student at the University of Göttingen, working under the supervision of Thomas Schick. 

In plain language, I study the underlying shape and symmetry of spacetime models and the mathematical structures that classify their properties.

More precisely, my research interests lie in algebraic topology, in particular twisted K-theory and topological T-duality.
My thesis is about the equivariant versions of these concepts.

<br>

I will be completing my PhD in September, after which I will move out of academia.
